Now lets shift fcus to all things spiral memory. Is it prduction ready? Do a deep dive into the codebase for all things spiral memory (Exclude "FlappyJournal hey" subdirectory as thats a backup folder)

n the repo for spiral memory modules and review their readiness.

I need to look into the production readiness of our system. The spiral memory en
gine is utilized within FlappyJournal, and it’s being accessed by the enhanced-d
ual-consciousness-ws module through a require statement. It's important to inspe
ct how enhanced-dual-consciousness-ws references the spiral memory engine to ens
ure everything is functioning as intended. I'll make sure to go through this car

**Evaluating SpiralMemory Configuration**

I’m looking into the spiralMemory from the FlappyJournal engine. It seems the pr
ersistence, except for the SnapshotService in server/index.ts, which utilizes a 
global Map. This brings up two notions of spiral memory: one is used by WS in Fl
appyJournal and the other for persistence snapshotting. I need to evaluate this 
potential inconsistency. Plus, there are environmental variables like SPIRAL_KMS
_KEY and others; I should investigate how they’re applied.
