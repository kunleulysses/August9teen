# Chaos Experiment Results

This directory stores the `ChaosResult` outputs captured from each Litmus experiment run. Files are named after the experiment and timestamped, e.g. `holograph-pod-kill-20240101030000.yaml`.

The directory also contains `cron.log` when experiments are scheduled via `scripts/schedule-chaos.sh`.
