# Provisional Patent Draft: Health Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Graceful Shutdown

**Module:** ConsciousnessResonanceNetworks.js (consciousness-core)

## Technical Field
This invention relates to distributed artificial intelligence, specifically to the health monitoring, diagnostics, and graceful shutdown of resonance networks for artificial consciousness systems.

## Background
Traditional distributed AI systems lack robust, real-time health monitoring, diagnostics, and safe shutdown procedures that ensure reliability, maintainability, and resilience. The present invention introduces a system for real-time health checks, diagnostics, and graceful shutdown, supporting advanced reliability, state persistence, and recovery. While the preferred embodiment uses event-driven and API-based methods, the invention is not limited to these and encompasses any mathematical, geometric, algorithmic, computational, or physical model for health monitoring, diagnostics, and shutdown.

## Summary of Invention
The invention provides a method and system for:
- Real-time health monitoring and diagnostics of network, node, field, and pattern status, using any present or future mathematical, geometric, algorithmic, computational, or physical model, including but not limited to event-driven, API-based, message-passing, data feed, sensor/actuator, quantum, neuromorphic, or analog approaches
- Health check APIs or interfaces for external status queries, returning detailed health, state, and diagnostic information
- Graceful shutdown procedures, including stopping timers, halting node processing, saving final state, unregistering from event buses, and setting system state to shutdown
- State persistence and recovery mechanisms for safe restart and resilience
- Modular and plug-in architectures allowing for the swapping or addition of new health monitoring, diagnostic, or shutdown algorithms
- Implementation in software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof, including distributed, cloud, edge, on-device, quantum, neuromorphic, or analog computing substrates
- Use of any data structure (graph, matrix, tensor, etc.), communication protocol (synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven, message-passing, etc.), and feedback, learning, or adaptation mechanism (AI, ML, evolutionary, etc.)
- Integration with external data sources, sensors, actuators, or other networks, and interoperability with other AI, ML, or distributed systems
