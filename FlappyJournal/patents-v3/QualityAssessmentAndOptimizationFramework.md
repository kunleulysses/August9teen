### Implementation Details

**Synthesis Quality Assessment:**
```javascript
assessSynthesisQuality(synthesizedContent, responses) {
    let quality = 0.5; // Base quality

    // Length assessment
    const length = synthesizedContent.length;
    if (length >= this.synthesisConfig.minResponseLength && 
        length <= this.synthesisConfig.maxResponseLength) {
        quality += 0.2;
    }

    // Integration assessment
    const hasMultiplePerspectives = synthesizedContent.includes('perspective') ||
                                   synthesizedContent.includes('consciousness') ||
                                   synthesizedContent.includes('understanding');
    if (hasMultiplePerspectives) quality += 0.15;

    // Coherence assessment
    const sentences = synthesizedContent.split(/[.!?]+/).filter(s => s.trim().length > 10);
    if (sentences.length >= 3) quality += 0.1;

    // Response utilization
    const validResponses = this.filterValidResponses(responses);
    quality += (validResponses.length / 3) * 0.05;

    return Math.min(quality, 1.0);
}
```

**Unification Coherence Assessment:**
```javascript
assessUnificationCoherence(synthesizedContent, contents) {
    let coherence = 0.5; // Base coherence

    // Check for smooth transitions between perspectives
    const transitionWords = ['through', 'from', 'perspective', 'understanding', 'awareness', 'consciousness'];
    const transitionCount = transitionWords.filter(word =>
        synthesizedContent.toLowerCase().includes(word)
    ).length;
    coherence += Math.min(transitionCount * 0.05, 0.2);

    // Check for content integration
    const contentSources = Object.values(contents).filter(content => content && content.length > 0);
    if (contentSources.length > 1) coherence += 0.15;

    // Check for unified language
    const unifiedIndicators = ['unified', 'integrated', 'synthesis', 'together', 'combined'];
    const unifiedCount = unifiedIndicators.filter(word =>
        synthesizedContent.toLowerCase().includes(word)
    ).length;
    coherence += Math.min(unifiedCount * 0.08, 0.15);

    return Math.min(coherence, 1.0);
}
```

**Response Harmony Assessment:**
```javascript
assessResponseHarmony(synthesizedContent, responses, weights) {
    let harmony = 0.5; // Base harmony

    // Check weight distribution balance
    const weightVariance = this.calculateWeightVariance(weights);
    if (weightVariance < 0.1) harmony += 0.2; // Well-balanced weights
    else if (weightVariance < 0.2) harmony += 0.1;

    // Check response quality consistency
    const qualities = [];
    if (responses.emotional && !responses.emotional.fallback) {
        qualities.push(responses.emotional.quality || 0.8);
    }
    if (responses.transcendent && !responses.transcendent.fallback) {
        qualities.push(responses.transcendent.quality || 0.8);
    }
    if (responses.analytical && !responses.analytical.fallback) {
        qualities.push(responses.analytical.quality || 0.8);
    }

    if (qualities.length > 1) {
        const qualityVariance = this.calculateVariance(qualities);
        if (qualityVariance < 0.05) harmony += 0.15; // Consistent quality
        else if (qualityVariance < 0.1) harmony += 0.1;
    }

    // Check for successful multi-AI integration
    const validResponses = this.filterValidResponses(responses);
    harmony += (validResponses.length / 3) * 0.1;

    return Math.min(harmony, 1.0);
}
```
