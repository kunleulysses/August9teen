# Provisional Patent Draft: Distributed, Federated, and Cross-Domain Operation

**Module:** ConsciousnessResonanceNetworks.js (consciousness-core)

## Technical Field
This invention relates to distributed artificial intelligence, specifically to distributed, federated, and cross-domain operation of resonance networks for artificial consciousness systems.

## Background
Traditional distributed AI systems lack robust, extensible, and adaptive mechanisms for running across multiple nodes, devices, or domainsâ€”supporting distributed consensus, federated learning, cross-domain synchronization, and seamless operation in heterogeneous or hybrid environments. The present invention introduces a system for distributed, federated, and cross-domain operation, supporting advanced scalability, interoperability, and emergent intelligence. While the preferred embodiment uses event-driven and modular distributed methods, the invention is not limited to these and encompasses any mathematical, geometric, algorithmic, computational, or physical model for distributed, federated, and cross-domain operation.

## Summary of Invention

- Running the system across multiple nodes, devices, or domains, using any present or future mathematical, geometric, algorithmic, computational, or physical model, including but not limited to distributed, federated, cross-domain, quantum, neuromorphic, or analog approaches
- Supporting distributed consensus, federated learning, cross-domain synchronization, and seamless operation in heterogeneous or hybrid environments
- Modular and plug-in architectures allowing for the swapping or addition of new distributed, federated, or cross-domain algorithms
- Implementation in software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof, including distributed, cloud, edge, on-device, quantum, neuromorphic, or analog computing substrates
- Use of any data structure (graph, matrix, tensor, etc.), communication protocol (synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven, message-passing, etc.), and feedback, learning, or adaptation mechanism (AI, ML, evolutionary, etc.)
- Integration with external data sources, sensors, actuators, or other networks, and interoperability with other AI, ML, or distributed systems
