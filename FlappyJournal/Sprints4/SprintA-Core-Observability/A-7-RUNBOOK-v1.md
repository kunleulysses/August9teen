# A-7: RUNBOOK v1

## Objective & Success Criteria
**Objective:**  
Create a comprehensive runbook covering overview, startup, shutdown, health checks, common failure scenarios, and SLOs for the Resonance-Network.

**Success Criteria:**  
- All engineers can operate the system using this runbook.
- SREs can recover from failure in &lt;2 min.
- Runbook is versioned and lives in-repo.

## Prerequisites / Dependencies
- Metrics, dashboards, and Redis snapshotting live.
- System deployable via Docker or k8s.

## Architectural Context
- Place in `FlappyJournal/Sprints4/SprintA-Core-Observability/RUNBOOK-v1.md`
- Reference to config files, Redis, and monitoring.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Overview**
   - System role in platform, key modules, dependencies.

2. **Startup**
   - Shell: `pnpm start` or `docker run ...`
   - Health check: `curl localhost:8080/healthz`
   - Metrics: `curl localhost:8080/metrics`

3. **Shutdown**
   - Send SIGTERM: `kill -TERM <pid>`
   - Graceful: Wait for `shutdown complete` log.

4. **Health/Recovery**
   - Check Redis connection: `redis-cli -h ...`
   - Restore snapshot: On boot, module auto-restores.

5. **Common Failure Modes**
   - Redis outage: Fallback to in-memory; recover state on return.
   - Worker pool saturation: Scale nodes, check logs.
   - API 500s: Check logs, restart service.

6. **SLOs**
   - p95 latency â‰¤ 120 ms
   - MTTR &lt; 2 min

7. **Support/Escalation**
   - Slack: #resonance-net
   - On-call: see `oncall.md`

## Observability Hooks
- All metrics in A-5
- Log all startup/shutdown events

## Security or Performance Considerations
- Only share runbook internally or via secured docs.

## Validation / Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Runbook complete and covers all ops tasks
- [ ] SREs can perform MTTR drill
- [ ] Docs updated as system evolves

## Rollback / Cleanup Notes
- Update or archive this file as system process changes.
