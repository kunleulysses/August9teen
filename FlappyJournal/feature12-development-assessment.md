## 📈 **REALISTIC CURRENT STATUS**

**Overall Feature 12 Status**: 🟡 **25-30% Complete**

- **Architecture**: ✅ **Excellent** - Sophisticated, well-designed structure
- **Scaffolding**: ✅ **Complete** - All frameworks and interfaces in place
- **Core Logic**: ❌ **Major gaps** - Most algorithms are placeholders
- **Integration**: 🟡 **Partial** - Framework exists, needs real implementation
- **Testing**: ❌ **Minimal** - Limited to basic health checks

**Estimated Development**: **9-13 weeks** for full operational status

**Priority Focus**: Implement core algorithms and real functionality to replace placeholder logic.
