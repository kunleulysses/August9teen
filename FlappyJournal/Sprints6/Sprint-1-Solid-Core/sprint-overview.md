## 1. Objective

Establish a robust, production-ready foundation for Consciousness-OS by hardening core runtime, introducing state isolation, offloading CPU work, implementing security gates, circuit-breakers, and test scaffolding.

## 2. Key Deliverables

- Atomic state isolation layer
- Worker pool for CPU-intensive computation
- Fastify-based security middleware (TLS, JWT, rate-limit)
- Circuit-breaker and retry wrappers around all external I/O
- Observability hooks (Prometheus metrics, logging)
- Comprehensive jest-based unit and concurrency tests

## 3. Timeline & Owners

- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks (10 business days)
- **Core Owners:**  
  - Tech Lead (coordination, review)  
  - Senior Backend Engineer (state, worker, circuit-breaker)  
  - Security Engineer (middleware, rate-limit)  
  - QA/DevOps (test, CI, metrics validation)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- All core modules refactored to use atomic state or state adapters
- Worker pool enabled for all heavy math/logic
- 100% of public endpoints protected by JWT and rate-limit
- All external calls wrapped with circuit-breakers (testable)
- Prometheus counters and histograms exported and visible in dev Grafana
- Test coverage ≥ 80% (unit + concurrency)
- All checklists in guides 01–06 marked complete
