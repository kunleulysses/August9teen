# Sprints6 Production Hardening Playbook

Welcome to the **Sprints6** folder. This directory contains fully structured, step-by-step guides for hardening and productionizing the Consciousness-OS platform. Every sprint is mapped to a subfolder, with detailed markdown files for each major engineering deliverable.

## Folder Structure

- `Sprint-1-Solid-Core/`  
  Foundational refactors: state isolation, worker pools, security, circuit-breaker, test scaffolds, observability.

- `Sprint-2-Safe-Observable/`  
  Advanced resilience: chaos harness, dashboards, TLS automation, memory GC, coverage gates, security scans.

- `Sprint-3-Future-Proof/`  
  Long-term reliability: STRIDE threat-model, nightly integrity, cluster shutdown, documentation handoff.

## How to Use

1. Start with `sprint-overview.md` in each folder for high-level goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
2. For each major engineering task, follow the corresponding numbered guide in order.
3. Each guide is self-contained: prerequisites, file paths, shell commands, validation steps, metrics, risks, and rollback.
4. Mark each checklist as complete before sprint close-out.

> **Tip:**  
> All files use ordered lists and section numbers for clarity. Code blocks are explicit. Best-practices appear as blockquotes.
