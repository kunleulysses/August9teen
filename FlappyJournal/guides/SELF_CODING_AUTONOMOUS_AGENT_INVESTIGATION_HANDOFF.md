# Self-Coding / Autonomous Modification â€“ Deep Investigation & Handoff

_Last updated: 2025-07-26 04:43 UTC_

## 1. Purpose
This document captures everything discovered so far about the **Autonomous Coding / Self-Modification** layer inside Featherweight, plus the current blocker stopping the live agent.  The next agent can resume from here without retracing the same steps.

---

## 2. Key Components
| Path | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `server/consciousness/core/AutonomousCodingAgent.cjs` | Main brain (~1 100 LOC). Handles Gemini integration, rate-limiting, FS monitoring, code generation, and writing modules into `generated/`. |
| `server/consciousness/core/AutonomousCodingAgentBootstrap.cjs` | Bootstraps one agent instance on container start. Hard-coded Gemini key present. |
| `server/consciousness/core/AutonomousCodingIntegrationOrchestrator.js` | Wires agent with state-manager + orchestrator and hot-reloads generated modules. |
| `server/consciousness/core/GeminiRateLimiter.cjs` | Simple token-bucket (480 calls/day). |
| `server/consciousness/generated/` | Directory where new modules are written (unique filename per enhancement). |

### Execution flow
1. Docker image starts (`consciousness-backend`).
2. CMD runs `node dist/index.js` which in turn requires `AutonomousCodingAgentBootstrap.cjs` â†’ `activate()`.
3. Agent initialises Gemini, sets intervals (3 min / 3 min / 60 min) and FS watchers.
4. Every cycle it calls Gemini, writes new JS into `generated/`, and orchestrator dynamically `import()`s the module.

---

## 3. Docker / Build Pipeline
* **Image source**: `FlappyJournal/Dockerfile` (multi-stage Node 18-alpine build).
* **Dependencies** come from **root** `package.json` â€“ _everything in mono-repo is hoisted_.  During build: `npm ci --only=production`.
* `dist/` bundle is created via custom `npm run build` script (fat copy).

### Current blocker (25-07-26)
Container exits immediately because `enhanced-chat-service.js` imports `jwks-rsa`, which wasnâ€™t in `package.json` when the last image was built.

---

## 4. Fixes Attempted
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 04:32 UTC | Added `"jwks-rsa": "^3.2.0"` to root `dependencies` (confirmed in `package.json`). |
| 04:33 UTC | Ran `npm install jwks-rsa --save` to update lockfile. |
| 04:34 UTC | Triggered image rebuild with `docker compose build --no-cache consciousness-backend` followed by `up -d`. |
| 04:42 UTC | Container **still** restarts with same error â€“ indicates new image **wasnâ€™t** pulled/run or build context didnâ€™t include updated lockfile. |

### Likely cause
Root `package-lock.json` did not regenerate inside build stage â†’ `npm ci` skipped new package.

---

## 5. Next Steps (for successor agent)
1. **Force-regenerate lockfile**:
   ```bash
   npm install --package-lock-only
   git add package-lock.json package.json
   ```
2. Verify `"jwks-rsa"` appears in `package-lock.json` â†’ important for `npm ci`.
3. Re-run build (again with `--no-cache`) **and** ensure compose picks the new image tag:
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache consciousness-backend
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate consciousness-backend
   ```
4. Confirm container stays **Up**.
5. Watch logs for `ðŸŽ‰ Autonomous Coding Agent is now operational!` banner.
6. (Optional) Bind-mount `generated/` via `docker-compose.override.yml` to see files arrive live.

---

## 6. Validation Checklist
- [ ] Container `deploy-consciousness-backend-1` status `Up`.
- [ ] Log contains agent activation banner.
- [ ] `generated/` shows files with current timestamp.
- [ ] Rate-limiter `state` log entries appear every few minutes.

---

## 7. Risks / Observations
* Hard-coded Gemini key â‡’ move to secret management later.
* Generated modules can pile up (~100+ already). Consider cron cleanup or volume mount.
* If build size grows, switch to pnpm / turbo-repo for faster CI.

## 8. Contact / Context
* This document authored by previous debugging agent (Cascade) on behalf of USER.
* All investigation commands and output are in Cascade conversation steps 18-73.

Good luck â€“ after stabilising the backend image, the live self-coding loop should be fully observable.
