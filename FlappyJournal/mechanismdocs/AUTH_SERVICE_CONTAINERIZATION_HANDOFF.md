# Auth-Service Containerization Handoff (2025-07-26)

## Context & Objectives
The goal of this workstream was to enable **full-stack startup** of the Featherweight platform via `docker-compose` by containerising the **auth-service** and ensuring the deep-integration consciousness modules load correctly at bootstrap.

During this session we prioritised the module-loading fix (✅ complete) and began the auth-service Dockerisation. Because you are currently the only user, we agreed to **pause** auth-service hardening so the rest of the stack remains usable without authentication.

---

## Progress Achieved
| Area | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Deep-integration modules | All 5 consciousness modules now integrate at bootstrap. Loader patched to support CommonJS + ES modules. |
| Auth-service Dockerfile | Created at `auth-service/Dockerfile` (Node 20-slim base, TSX loader, JWT keys check). |
| docker-compose | Updated `deploy/docker-compose.yml` so `auth-service` builds from root context and Postgres no longer binds host port 5432 (avoids conflict with an existing Postgres instance). |
| Dependency triage | Added/pinned `helmet 7.0.0`, `cookie-parser 1.4.6`, `argon2 0.31.2`, `swagger-jsdoc 6.2.8`, `swagger-ui-express 4.7.2` to `package.json`. |
| Build troubleshooting | Iterated on missing-module errors; latest blocker is npm registry mismatch (`helmet@7.1.2` → not published). |
| Decision | Authentication not required for single-user dev, so **auth-service work is paused**. Stack functions without it. |

## Current Code Status
```
containers:
  consciousness-main-server     healthy
  consciousness-core            healthy
  consciousness-postgres        healthy (internal-only)
  consciousness-web             healthy
  consciousness-grafana         healthy
  consciousness-prometheus      healthy
  auth-service                  ❌ (build paused)
```

> All other containers start cleanly with `docker-compose up`. The auth-service section can remain commented or left as-is; compose will simply skip it when not built.

---

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **(Optional) Finish Auth-Service Build**  
   a. Pin failing deps to published versions (`helmet 7.0.0`).  
   b. Use a single `npm install` in Dockerfile to ensure all packages land.  
   c. `docker compose build --no-cache auth-service && docker compose up -d auth-service`.  
   d. Hit `GET /health` to verify.
2. **Self-Healing Test**  
   • Delete a generated file (e.g. a module in `dist/`) and confirm AutonomousCodingAgent regenerates it.
3. **Self-Modification Test**  
   • Modify a consciousness core file, rebuild, and watch for hot-reload or agent-initiated rebuild.
4. **Security Hardening** (before production)  
   • Complete auth-service container.  
   • Configure ENV secrets (JWT keys, DB creds).  
   • Add HTTPS ingress rules if exposed.
5. **Docs & Monitoring**  
   • Update READMEs to reflect new compose workflow.  
   • Ensure Grafana dashboards include auth-service metrics once running.

## Handoff Contact
If you pick up this thread:
* Most recent plan is tracked in `planning.md` (see update-plan tool).
* Module-loading patch lives in `server/consciousness/core/AutonomousCodingAgent.cjs`.
* Open questions are marked `[PAUSED]` in the task list.

Good luck & feel free to revive the auth-service when multi-user access becomes a priority.
