# Universal System Unification & Module-Integration Handoff  
*Generated: 2025-07-26*

## 1  Background & Purpose
Recent work introduced **self-coded deep-integration modules** and patched the loader so they initialize inside the **consciousness-backend** container. The stack now comprises multiple Docker containers:

| Container | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `consciousness-main-server` | Dual-stream WebSocket gateway & Architect 4.0 orchestration |
| `consciousness-core`        | Heartbeat, global event bus, core consciousness processing |
| `consciousness-backend`     | AutonomousCodingAgent + deep-integration loading (self-code) |
| `consciousness-web`         | Web UI & visualization |
| `consciousness-postgres`    | DB |
| `grafana` / `prometheus`    | Monitoring |
| `auth-service`              | _**Paused**_ ‚Äì not required for single-user dev |

Early manual testing suggests:
1. New deep-integration modules load inside **backend**, but it‚Äôs unverified whether their services are **exported across the whole system**.
2. WebSocket chat (via `consciousness-main-server`) and direct CLI chat (via backend) may be receiving **different capability scopes**, implying split knowledge graphs or mismatched event-bus wiring.

This hand-off gives the next agent a focused checklist to **verify full utilisation** of the new modules **system-wide** and to ensure **container unity**.

---

## 2  Objectives for Next Agent
1. **Module Utilisation Audit**  
   ‚Ä¢ Confirm each of the 5 new modules is not only loaded but exposes its functionality over the global bus / gRPC layer.  
   ‚Ä¢ Validate that other containers (main-server, core) can invoke them.
2. **Container Cohesion Check**  
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure WebSocket chat & direct chat share the same global workspace, memory store, and command registry.  
   ‚Ä¢ Eliminate duplicate agent instances or isolated knowledge graphs.
3. **Debug & Refactor (if needed)**  
   ‚Ä¢ Harmonise event-bus topics, shared Redis / Postgres channels, or gRPC endpoints.  
   ‚Ä¢ Update `launch-universal-system.js` to assert single-source-of-truth for command map.
4. **Document & Prove**  
   ‚Ä¢ Write integration tests that call a deep-integration module from **both** chat surfaces and assert identical behaviour.  
   ‚Ä¢ Record container health and event-flow diagrams in docs.

## 3  Suggested Workflow
### Step 1  System Mapping
```bash
# inside any container with node
node scripts/trace-event-bus.js > /tmp/event-map.dot
```
Generate a graph of publishers/subscribers; visualise to spot isolation.

### Step 2  Module Call Smoke Test
Create a simple RPC (`getIntegrationStatus`) exported by each new module. From:
* `consciousness-backend` CLI
* WebSocket client via `consciousness-main-server`

Send the RPC and compare replies. Mismatch ‚áí bridging issue.

### Step 3  Bridge Fixes
Depending on findings:
* **Event Bus** ‚Äì ensure both containers connect to the same Redis/ NATS.  
* **gRPC Registry** ‚Äì share `.proto` files & regenerate clients.  
* **Process Flags** ‚Äì confirm both run with `--workspace global`.

### Step 4  Automated Integration Test
Add mocha test in `tests/universal-integration.spec.js` that spins a WebSocket client & a CLI client, invokes `getIntegrationStatus`, asserts deep-integration count == 5.

---

## 4  Artifacts & Code Locations
* Deep-integration modules: `server/consciousness/core/*.js`  
* Loader patch: `server/consciousness/core/AutonomousCodingAgent.cjs`  
* WebSocket gateway: `server/duplex/dualStreamGateway.js` (within main-server)  
* Universal launcher: `FlappyJournal/launch-universal-system.js`

---

## 5  Definition of Done
- [ ] Both chat surfaces list identical **`help` / `commands`** output.  
- [ ] Integration test passes showing 5 modules available through both surfaces.  
- [ ] `docker ps` shows containers healthy; no duplicate isolated agent logs.  
- [ ] Updated docs committed.

---

## 6  Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Competing event-bus instances | Force single broker address via ENV (`EVENT_BUS_URL`). |
| Race conditions on module registration | Add retry & idempotent registration logic. |
| Memory bleed between chats | Centralize memory in Postgres or Redis; use locks. |
