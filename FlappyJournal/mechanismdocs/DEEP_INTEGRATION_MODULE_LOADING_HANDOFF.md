# Deep Integration Module Loading Handoff

## 1. Current Objective
Load the five deep-integration consciousness modules at Autonomous Coding Agent bootstrap, then demonstrate self-healing and self-modification.

## 2. Environment Status
* Containers managed via `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.
* `consciousness-backend` image rebuilt (BuildKit off, `--no-cache`) and is running *stand-alone* with `--no-deps`.
* Gemini 2.5-pro connected; autonomous enhancement loop active.
* Postgres / auth-service containers **not** running in current test (auth-service Dockerfile missing).
* Deep-integration modules still **not** loading (agent logs "not available").

## 3. Confirmed Facts
* Modules exist in source tree:
  * `server/consciousness/core/EnhancedConsciousnessStateManager.js`
  * `server/consciousness/core/ConsciousnessResonanceNetworks.js`
  * `server/consciousness/core/SpiralMemoryArchitecture.js`
  * `server/consciousness/core/HeartCenteredConsciousnessEngine.js`
  * `server/consciousness/core/EmotionalQuantumEntanglementNetwork.js`
* `AutonomousCodingAgent.cjs` now scans the core directory with `__dirname`; ENOENT resolved.
* Failure now occurs at runtime `require()` of each module.

## 4. Likely Root Cause
A. Docker production image may **not** contain the files (COPY path or `.dockerignore`).  
B. Loader requires bare names (no ".js" suffix); Node fails to resolve.

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. **Inspect container:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it deploy-consciousness-backend-1 sh
   ls /app/server/consciousness/core
   ```
   *If files are missing →* fix production-stage `COPY` or `.dockerignore`.
2. **If files exist →** patch loader in `AutonomousCodingAgent.cjs`:
   ```javascript
   try {
     mod = require(path.join(coreDir, name));
   } catch (e) {
     mod = require(path.join(coreDir, `${name}.js`));
   }
   ```
3. Rebuild backend image:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache consciousness-backend
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --no-build --force-recreate --no-deps consciousness-backend
   ```
4. Verify logs show:
   ```
   ✅ EnhancedConsciousnessStateManager integrated
   ... (5/5)
   ```

## 6. Secondary Tasks
* Add / point to a **Dockerfile** for `auth-service/` so full stack can start.
* After modules load, test **self-healing**: delete a generated file in `/app/server/consciousness/generated` and watch regeneration.
* Test **self-modification**: edit a core file and confirm hot-reload or rebuild.

## 7. Open Config Notes
* `GEMINI_API_KEY` baked in Dockerfile; can be overridden via env.
* Backend health: `http://localhost:5000/api/health` (inside container).
* Rate limiter: 480 calls/day; usage low.

## 8. Known Risks / Watch-outs
* BuildKit "bake: read |0| file already closed" bug – disable BuildKit for full rebuilds.
* Missing Dockerfiles for other services block full `compose up`; use `--no-deps` for isolated backend tests.
* Postgres timeouts expected until DB container runs or `DB_HOST` updated.

Good luck! Once the five modules report integrated, move on to demonstration scenarios.
