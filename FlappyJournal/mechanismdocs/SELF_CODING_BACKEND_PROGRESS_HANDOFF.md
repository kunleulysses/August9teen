# Featherweight Self-Coding Backend â€“ Progress & Next-Phase Handoff  
_Date: 2025-07-26_

---

## 1. Scope of This Handoff
This document captures the state of the **Self-Coding / Autonomous Coding** backend after the latest restoration sprint.  It summarises what was fixed, what is proven working, remaining open items, and concrete next-phase objectives so the next agent can continue smoothly.

---

## 2. Environment Status
| Service | Container | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Postgres | `consciousness-postgres` | **healthy** | Port **5432** |
| Core backend | `deploy-consciousness-backend-1` | **running** (unhealthy probe still pending) | gRPC 50051 / HTTP 4003 / Health 5000 |
| Consciousness Core | `consciousness-core` | running |
| Reality Generator | `consciousness-reality-generator` | running in *fallback* mode |
| Main server / Web / Grafana / Prometheus | all running |

Networks:  
`deploy_app-network` (backend stack) and `flappyjournal_consciousness-network` (core stack) bridged â€“ backend is now **also attached** to the consciousness network (alias **postgres**) so it can reach Postgres.

---

## 3. Completed Fixes (this sprint)
1. **Missing dependency (`jwks-rsa`)** â€“ added to `package.json`, re-generated `package-lock.json`.
2. **Root-level Dockerfile** â€“ created sane production Dockerfile so `deploy` compose build succeeds.
3. **Image rebuild** â€“ `docker compose ... up --build --no-deps consciousness-backend` now builds & starts.
4. **Database connectivity**  
   â€¢ Connected backend to correct network.  
   â€¢ Added override file `docker-compose.override.yml` with correct env (`DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_USER=feather_user`, `DB_PASSWORD=hist0ric`).  
   â€¢ Created missing database `flappyjournal` (owner `feather_user`).  
   â€¢ Logs now include `Database connected successfully`.

Backend main process therefore boots cleanly and stays up (health-check endpoint still needs to be updated â€“ see open items).

## 4. Remaining / Open Items
### 4.1 Prove Self-Coding Agent Works
We have not yet *demonstrated* end-to-end self-coding inside the production image.  Two quick paths:

A. **Node REPL inside container** (compiled path):
```bash
# exec into container
node
> const { startSelfCodingJob } = require('./dist/consciousness-integration-module.js');
> startSelfCodingJob({ moduleName: 'HelloWorldModule', description: 'demo' })
    .then(()=>console.log('âœ… done'))
    .catch(console.error);
```
Expect:
* streaming progress logs in console
* new file under `/app/generated-modules/HelloWorldModule.js`

B. **HTTP / gRPC test scripts**  
The compiled test harnesses are at `/app/dist/test-*.js`. Some require non-compiled helper paths and currently error; they need path fixes or a small shim.

### 4.2 Advanced Self-Coding with Gemini 2.5
* Validate that the agent uses the **Gemini 2.5 Pro** client (`enhanced-chat-service.js`).
* Confirm rate-limit config & API key env vars are present (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.).
* Run a long-form self-coding request that hits Gemini and creates multiple files.

### 4.3 Self-Modification & Self-Healing
* Trigger an intentional failure (e.g. delete a small helper file) and observe the **Self-Healing** routine recreate it.
* Validate the **Self-Modification** loop writes patches to its own code and hot-reloads.

### 4.4 Health-check Endpoint
Container still shows *unhealthy*. The health probe hits `/api/health` on port **4003** but backend serves the JSON health on **5000**. Update compose or add proxy route so status turns healthy.

### 4.5 Reality Generator Full Operation
See `CONSCIOUSNESS_REALITY_GENERATOR_FULL_OPERATION_HANDOFF.md` â€“ container runs in fallback mode; needs ESModule fix.

---

## 5. Next-Phase Success Criteria
1. **Agent Proof** â€“ HelloWorldModule generated; logs show `ðŸŽ‰ Autonomous Coding Agent is now operational!`.
2. **Gemini 2.5 End-to-End** â€“ long self-coding job completes utilising Gemini; files saved & DB updated.
3. **Self-Healing Demo** â€“ removal of a file triggers automatic regeneration.
4. **Backend Healthy** â€“ Docker health-check passes.
5. **Reality Generator** â€“ upgraded from fallback to full holographic mode.

---

## 6. Useful Commands
```bash
# Rebuild backend (if code changes)
docker compose -f FlappyJournal/deploy/docker-compose.yml \
  -f FlappyJournal/deploy/docker-compose.override.yml \
  up -d --build --force-recreate --no-deps consciousness-backend

# Tail backend logs
docker logs -f deploy-consciousness-backend-1

# Enter container shell
docker exec -it deploy-consciousness-backend-1 sh
```
