# Ticket C7 – Comprehensive Handoff Pack & KT Workshop

## Goal
Produce a complete, up-to-date handoff package (run-books, diagrams, slides, API docs, backup/recovery SOPs), and deliver a live knowledge transfer (KT) workshop so any new engineer or SRE pod can own Sigil-DNA with zero ambiguity.

## Context

A common failure mode in complex systems is poor handoff—tribal knowledge, stale docs, and missing diagrams leave the next team in the dark. Sprint 3 is the moment to lock in operational maturity. The handoff pack should:
- Be a single source of truth for architecture, operations, and recovery
- Contain all critical artefacts: up-to-date diagrams, run-books, SOPs, API schemas, migration/restore docs, test results, and onboarding checklists
- Be accessible in the repo and as downloadable PDFs/slides
- KT workshop (recorded or live) to walk through architecture, hot paths, troubleshooting, and escalation

Key files:
- `docs/ARCH_SIGIL_TOPOLOGY.mmd` (architecture diagram, Mermaid or similar)
- `docs/RUNBOOK_SIGIL_DNA.md` (run-book)
- `docs/API_SIGIL_DNA.md` (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_SIGIL_DNA.md` (backup, migration, and restore SOPs)
- `docs/KT_SLIDES_SIGIL_DNA.pdf` (slide deck)
- `scripts/verify-handoff.sh` (checks for up-to-date artefacts)
- All referenced in README and onboarding docs

## Prerequisites

- Access to all system diagrams, code, scripts, and prior tickets
- Mermaid, draw.io, or Lucidchart for diagrams
- Slide deck tool (Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Markdown PDF)
- Markdown and PDF export tools (`pandoc`, `md-to-pdf`)
- Video recording (for KT session, optional)
- ENV: None specific

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Update All Diagrams

- Export architecture as Mermaid (`ARCH_SIGIL_TOPOLOGY.mmd`) and as PNG/PDF
- Include storage, API, auth, CI/CD, monitoring, and failure modes

### 2. Write/Update Run-Books

- Create `docs/RUNBOOK_SIGIL_DNA.md` with:
  - Quickstart
  - Deployment/upgrade
  - Backup/restore (see below)
  - Common troubleshooting (healthcheck fails, disk full, DB lock)
  - Alert response/escalation

### 3. API and OpenAPI Docs

- Use Swagger/OpenAPI 3.1 in `docs/API_SIGIL_DNA.md`
- Document all endpoints, request/response schemas, and error codes
- Include curl examples and test tokens

### 4. Backup, Migration, and Restore SOP

- `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_SIGIL_DNA.md`:
  - How to backup LevelDB, Postgres
  - Nightly integrity job usage
  - Migration from JSON/legacy
  - Disaster recovery steps

### 5. Onboarding Checklist

- Add an onboarding section to README:
  - Prereqs (Node, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana)
  - How to run all tests (unit, heavy, mutation, chaos)
  - How to verify health and observability

### 6. Prepare KT Slides

- KT deck (PDF or Google Slides):
  - System architecture
  - API surface
  - Critical flows (encode, verify, alert, recovery)
  - Monitoring and escalation
  - Contact/escalation tree

### 7. Run KT Workshop

- Schedule live or record video walk-through (Zoom, Loom, etc.)
- Cover all artefacts, demo live system, Q&A

### 8. Add Handoff Verification Script

- `scripts/verify-handoff.sh`:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   for f in docs/ARCH_SIGIL_TOPOLOGY.mmd docs/RUNBOOK_SIGIL_DNA.md docs/API_SIGIL_DNA.md docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_SIGIL_DNA.md; do
     [ -f "$f" ] || { echo "Missing $f"; exit 1; }
   done
   ```

---

## Verification

### Automated

- Run verify-handoff.sh; all artefacts present and up to date
- All links and diagrams render correctly in docs

### Manual

- New engineer follows onboarding checklist, brings up full stack in <1 day
- SRE/operator performs backup/restore with docs only

### KT Session

- All topics covered, slides match code, recording archived for future

---

## Rollback

- Restore old run-books, diagrams, and docs:
  ```
  git checkout HEAD~1 -- docs/
  ```
- Remove/replace KT slides if needed

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All artefacts present and current
- Any new pod can onboard, recover, and operate system unaided
- KT session delivered and recorded

---
