# Sprint 5: Release Readiness – Overview

## Goal
Finalize all operational, release, and rollout tasks to safely transition Holographic Reality Generation to production.

## Prerequisites
- Sprints 0–4 complete (all tests, metrics, security, scaling)
- Staging and production environments available
- Argo Rollouts, SBOM tools, and feature flag infra set up

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Prepare and execute blue-green rollout using Argo Rollouts (see 01-Blue-Green-Rollout.md)
2. Finalize and publish Ops runbook and incident documentation (see 02-Runbook-And-Ops-Docs.md)
3. Generate SBOM and automate release publishing (see 03-SBOM-And-Release-Workflow.md)
4. Manage and monitor feature flag rollout for final cutover (see 04-Feature-Flag-Rollout.md)
5. Conduct final go/no-go review and tag GA release

## Verification & Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Blue-green rollout executed with zero downtime
- [ ] All ops docs and runbooks in place and tested
- [ ] SBOM and signed release published for v0.1.0-holo
- [ ] Feature flag enabled fully in prod, monitored for issues

## Time Estimate & Owner
- 1 week (Dev Rel, SRE, Security)

## Common Pitfalls & Mitigations
- **Pitfall:** Rollback not tested ahead of time  
  **Mitigation:** Practice both manual and automated rollback in staging

- **Pitfall:** Runbooks missing links or outdated  
  **Mitigation:** Review and test with a new team member for completeness

- **Pitfall:** Feature flag misfires, partial rollout stuck  
  **Mitigation:** Monitor flag status, automate percentage increases
