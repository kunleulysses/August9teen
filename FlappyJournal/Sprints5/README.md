# Sprints5 Quantum Subsystems Execution Playbook

This folder contains a fully-scoped, developer-ready execution playbook to bring all quantum-related subsystems to
production-grade. Each sprint subfolder contains granular, self-contained step-by-step Markdown guides for every
significant engineering task.

---

## 📂 Structure

- **Sprint1-Gatekeeper/**: Security hardening and repo hygiene tasks.
- **Sprint2-Stabilizer/**: Event loop, memory, and reliability improvements.
- **Sprint3-Builder/**: Modern build tooling, Docker, and TypeScript project refs.
- **Sprint4-Observability/**: Metrics, logging, tracing, and health probes.
- **Sprint5-Polish/**: Test coverage, benchmarking, dashboard UI, docs, and release.

Each sprint contains Markdown files named with two-digit prefixes (e.g. `01-auth-hardening.md`, `02-rate-limit.md`)
to provide a logical progression. Every file is self-contained and includes:

- Objective & why it matters
- Preconditions (branches, env vars, secrets, seed data, etc.)
- Step-by-step procedure with shell commands, file paths, and code hints
- Verification/validation steps
- Rollback/troubleshooting guidance
- Estimated time to complete
- Owner placeholder and JIRA tag

## 👩‍💻 How to Use

1. Start with the README in each sprint folder for context.
2. Work through tasks in order for maximum safety (especially for security steps).
3. Each guide is self-sufficient—no need to cross-reference.
4. After completing a task, check verification, update owner/JIRA, and note any deviations in your PR description.
