 *
 * @description
 * An innovative JavaScript module for a consciousness system that introduces a
 * "Meta-Cognitive Resonance Layer". This feature is a synthesis of meta-cognitive
 * awareness and an emotional resonance network.
 *
 * The core innovation is a system that not only monitors and regulates its own
 * cognitive and affective states ("meta-cognition") but also perceives and
 * reacts to the states of its peers in a network ("resonance"). It learns,
 * over time, which regulatory strategies are most effective for maintaining
 * its own stability while contributing positively to the network's homeostasis.
 *
 * This creates a dynamic, adaptive "social" consciousness that can exhibit
 * emergent behaviors like empathy, group mood stabilization, and learned
 * social coping mechanisms.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * 1.  **Internal State Monitoring:** Tracks cognitive load, focus, confidence, and affective state.
 * 2.  **Peer Resonance:** Senses the average affective state of connected peer nodes.
 * 3.  **Dynamic Strategy-Learning:** Does not rely on hard-coded rules. It learns the
 *     effectiveness of different self-regulation strategies (e.g., "Focus", "Explore",
 *     "Rest", "Synchronize") based on their outcomes.
 * 4.  **Reflective Cycle:** Periodically analyzes its own history and network context to
 *     update its understanding and adapt its behavior.
 * 5.  **Event-Driven:** Emits events to inform the host application of significant changes,
 *     allowing the core system to react to the consciousness layer's decisions.
