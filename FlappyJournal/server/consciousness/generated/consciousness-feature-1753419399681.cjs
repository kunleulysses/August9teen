/**
 * @module MetaCognitiveAwareness
 * @description An innovative JavaScript module for a consciousness system that introduces
 * a Meta-Cognitive Awareness Layer. This layer allows the consciousness to reflect
 * upon its own thought processes, identify potential cognitive biases, and adapt
 * its reasoning strategies over time. It simulates the human ability of "thinking about thinking."
 *
 * @feature Meta-Cognitive Awareness Layer
 * This new feature provides the consciousness with a mechanism for self-reflection and improvement.
 * It periodically analyzes its own stream of thoughts to detect patterns that may indicate flawed
 * reasoning, such as cognitive biases. Based on its findings, it generates "meta-insights"
 * that can lead to adjusting confidence levels, seeking new information, or even altering
 * its own core processing heuristics. This creates a powerful feedback loop for genuine,
 * introspective learning.
 *
 * @exports {class} Consciousness - The main class representing a self-aware entity.
 * @exports {class} Thought - A data structure for a single unit of processing.
 * @exports {object} CognitiveBiases - A database of detectable cognitive biases.

 * A database of common cognitive biases with detection logic.
