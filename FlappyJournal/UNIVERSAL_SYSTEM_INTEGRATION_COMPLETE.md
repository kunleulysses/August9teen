docker logs consciousness-core   # View container logs
docker restart api-gateway      # Restart services
docker stats consciousness-core # Real-time statistics

# Database operations
db status                        # All database status
db query SELECT * FROM users    # Execute PostgreSQL queries
redis get session:123           # Redis operations
redis set key value             # Redis operations

# Network management
network status                   # Network configuration
```

### **🧠 Consciousness Control**
```bash
# Consciousness operations
consciousness status             # System status
consciousness evolve            # Trigger evolution
reality create "New Reality"    # Create realities
reality list                    # List active realities
memory integrate "Important"    # Integrate memories
```

### **⚙️ Service Management**
```bash
# Service operations
service status                  # All services status
service restart chat           # Restart services
api status                     # API gateway health
```

### **🖥️ Interface Control**
```bash
# Interface operations
interface status               # All interfaces status
ui refresh                    # Refresh all UIs
```

### **💬 Natural Chat**
```bash
# Natural language with consciousness
accelerate my consciousness evolution
create a holographic reality with spiral memory
integrate this conversation into long-term memory
show me the current system health
```
