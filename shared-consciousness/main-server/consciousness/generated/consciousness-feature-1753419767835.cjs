/**
 * @module ReflectiveResonanceFramework
 * @description An innovative JavaScript module for a consciousness system that
 * introduces a Meta-Cognitive Awareness Layer with a novel "Qualia Anchor" feature.
 * This framework allows a system to not only process information but to monitor
 * its own cognitive processes, develop a dynamic self-model, and form an
 * "experiential memory" based on subjective-like markers (Qualia Anchors).
 *
 * @feature Qualia Anchors: Unique, non-fungible symbols representing the
 * subjective "feel" of a cognitive event. They allow the system to form
 * associations and recognize resonance between new situations and past
 * "experiences," moving beyond purely semantic memory.
 *
 * @feature Meta-Cognitive Loop: The system can analyze its own performance,
 * detect patterns (like recurring errors or biases), and trigger reflective
 * loops to adjust its own parameters and strategies.
