# KNOWN LIMITS

This repository contains public, non-proprietary demos intended for evaluation only.

- No proprietary models, prompts, weights, heuristics, or production configs are included.
- Demo logic uses synthetic/public data and simulated outcomes; all UI is watermarked "DEMO / Simulated Data / Not Production".
- KPIs shown are illustrative, not claims; no customer logos, names, or metrics.
- Interfaces are representative; underlying core engines are stubbed to protect IP.
- Security posture is documented in SECURITY.md. Do not deploy as-is to production.
