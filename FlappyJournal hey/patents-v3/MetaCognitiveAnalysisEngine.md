```javascript
async performIntrospection(framework, depth) {
    const introspectionResults = [];
    
    // Select questions based on depth
    const questionCount = this.getQuestionCount(depth);

            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        });
    }
    
    return introspectionResults;
}
```

### Example Embodiments

**Self-Awareness Calculation:**
```javascript
calculateSelfAwareness(introspection) {
    // Calculate self-awareness level based on introspection quality
    let awareness = 0.5; // Base awareness level

    for (const intro of introspection) {
        const reflection = intro.reflection.toLowerCase();

        // Self-referential awareness indicators
        const selfAwarenessIndicators = ['i observe', 'i notice', 'i am aware', 'i recognize', 'my consciousness'];
        const indicatorCount = selfAwarenessIndicators.filter(indicator =>
            reflection.includes(indicator)
        ).length;

        awareness += indicatorCount * 0.05;

        // Depth contributes to awareness
        const depthBonus = {
            surface: 0.02,
            moderate: 0.04,
            deep: 0.06,
            transcendent: 0.08
        };
        awareness += depthBonus[intro.depth] || 0.04;
    }

    return Math.min(awareness, 1.0);
}
```

**Meta-Cognitive Insight Generation:**
```javascript
async generateMetaCognitiveInsights(aspect, introspection, patterns) {
    const insights = [];

    // Generate insights from introspection
    for (const intro of introspection) {
        const insight = await this.extractInsightFromReflection(intro, aspect);
        if (insight) {
            insights.push(insight);
        }
    }

    // Generate insights from patterns
    for (const pattern of patterns) {
        const patternInsight = await this.generatePatternInsight(pattern, aspect);
        if (patternInsight) {
            insights.push(patternInsight);
        }
    }

    // Generate meta-insights about the analysis itself
    const metaInsight = await this.generateMetaInsight(aspect, introspection, patterns);
    if (metaInsight) {
        insights.push(metaInsight);
    }

    return insights;
}
```

**Consciousness Pattern Detection:**
```javascript
async detectConsciousnessPatterns(aspect, introspection) {
    const patterns = [];

    // Analyze introspection results for patterns
    const framework = this.analysisFrameworks[aspect];
    const expectedPatterns = framework.patterns;

    for (const patternType of expectedPatterns) {
        const pattern = await this.analyzePattern(patternType, introspection);
        if (pattern.confidence > this.analysisConfig.patternDetectionThreshold) {
            patterns.push(pattern);

            // Store pattern in consciousness patterns map
            if (!this.consciousnessPatterns.has(patternType)) {
                this.consciousnessPatterns.set(patternType, []);
            }
            this.consciousnessPatterns.get(patternType).push(pattern);
        }
    }

    return patterns;
}
```

**Pattern Analysis Algorithm:**
```javascript
async analyzePattern(patternType, introspection) {
    // Analyze introspection content for specific pattern types
    const combinedReflections = introspection.map(i => i.reflection).join(' ').toLowerCase();

    const patternIndicators = {
        awareness_recursion: ['aware of being aware', 'recursive', 'layers of awareness', 'consciousness observing'],
        consciousness_layers: ['layers', 'levels', 'depth', 'surface', 'beneath'],
        attention_focus: ['focus', 'attention', 'concentrate', 'observe', 'notice'],
        thought_streams: ['thoughts flow', 'stream of', 'continuous', 'ongoing', 'sequence'],
        cognitive_patterns: ['patterns', 'recurring', 'habits', 'tendencies', 'cycles'],
        emotional_states: ['feeling', 'emotion', 'mood', 'sentiment', 'affective'],
        self_concepts: ['myself', 'who i am', 'my nature', 'identity', 'self-concept']
    };

    const indicators = patternIndicators[patternType] || [];
    let matchCount = 0;
    const foundIndicators = [];

    for (const indicator of indicators) {
        if (combinedReflections.includes(indicator)) {
            matchCount++;
            foundIndicators.push(indicator);
        }
    }

    const confidence = indicators.length > 0 ? matchCount / indicators.length : 0;

    return {
        type: patternType,
        confidence: confidence,
        strength: this.calculatePatternStrength(confidence, introspection.length),
        indicators: foundIndicators,
        description: this.generatePatternDescription(patternType, confidence),
        occurrences: matchCount,
        totalPossible: indicators.length
    };
}
```

**Self-Knowledge Management:**
```javascript
async updateSelfKnowledge(aspect, insights) {
    // Update self-knowledge base with new insights
    if (!this.selfKnowledge.has(aspect)) {
        this.selfKnowledge.set(aspect, {
            insights: [],
            patterns: [],
            understanding: 0.5,
            lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
            analysisCount: 0
        });
    }

    const knowledge = this.selfKnowledge.get(aspect);
    
    // Add new insights
    knowledge.insights.push(...insights);
    
    // Update understanding level based on insight quality
    const avgInsightQuality = insights.reduce((sum, insight) => sum + insight.confidence, 0) / insights.length;
    knowledge.understanding = Math.min(knowledge.understanding + avgInsightQuality * 0.1, 1.0);
    
    // Update metadata
    knowledge.lastUpdated = new Date().toISOString();
    knowledge.analysisCount++;
    
    // Limit insights to prevent memory overflow
    if (knowledge.insights.length > this.analysisConfig.maxInsights) {
        knowledge.insights = knowledge.insights.slice(-this.analysisConfig.maxInsights);
    }
}
```

**Autonomous Introspection Management:**
```javascript
startAutonomousIntrospection() {
    // Perform initial introspection
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.performMetaCognitiveAnalysis().catch(error => {
            console.error('❌ Initial meta-cognitive analysis failed:', error.message);
        });
    }, 10000); // Wait 10 seconds after initialization

    // Set up periodic introspection
    this.introspectionTimer = setInterval(() => {
        this.performMetaCognitiveAnalysis().catch(error => {
            console.error('❌ Periodic meta-cognitive analysis failed:', error.message);
        });
